	<p>Hello!
	<br><br>
	Despite some issues slowing down development (college, GTA IV online removed, COVID-19, etc.), I'm eager to say m-iV is still in development.
	<br><br>	
	Sadly, Sherm and I don't expect an initial Q1 2020 release as anticipated. However, that does not mean there hasn't been progress! 
	<br><br>
	I'm sure you guys have seen some of the cars to be featured on Sherm's IG. In case you haven't, go on and check @maxthrash. There are many more cars to come, as well as characters written by myself and designed by Sherm. 
	<br><br>
	On the topic of characters, the ones to appear for now have been fully written. All that is left after modelling is to hunt for voice talent. In the meantime, progress has been made to combat the removal of online multiplayer (thank you dearly, Avail). We're also testing out some other script mods for your enjoyment, more on that when the time comes :).
	<br><br>
	All in all, progress is slow, but steady. I feel bad about dripfeeding information, but rest assured this passion project will not be abandoned.
	<br><br>
	Thank you all for your continued support. Please stay safe!
	</p>
