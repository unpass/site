	<h1>website launch and update</h1>
	
	<p>Hello! Thanks for checking out the site. There's not much to say about it, other than that it's essentially a hub for my Instagram and YouTube content (though the latter is quite inactive). I had a lot of fun making it for my midterm.
	<br><br>
	I plan on improving the site over time, but right now my priorities are set on continuing development for Millenia IV.
	<br><br>	
	The first episode of m-iV is slated to release sometime in Q1 2020. The series will be nothing like V was, but for all the better. While I cannot speak too much of the project, I can comfortably say that its planning and writing stages are essentially complete. There's still a LOT of work to be done in order to even begin recording, but rest assured we've been hard at work. I'm eager to share as many details as I can throughout the following months, and throughout 2020 as more episodes roll out.
	<br><br>
	We hope you stick around!
	</p>
